# recipe_calory_project

## INTRODUCTION

This project investigates the Recipes and Ratings dataset from food.com, consisting of thousands of recipes and user ratings since 2008. After merging and cleaning the raw data, our final working dataset constains 234429 rows.

The main question that we are focusing on is: Whether the time taken to make a recipe affect the number of calories? 

This question is important because understanding the relationship between cooking time and number of calories can help home cooks make better dietary decisions and optimize their meal plannings. For instance, people may asusme that recipes which takes longer to make are more indulgent, while quick recipes might be healthier. By analyzing this relationship, we can provide insights for users aiming for specific nutritional or time goals.
