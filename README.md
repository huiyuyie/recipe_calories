## INTRODUCTION

This project investigates the **Recipes and Ratings** dataset from [food.com](https://www.food.com/), consisting of thousands of recipes and user ratings since 2008. After merging and cleaning the raw data, our final working dataset constains **234429 rows**.

### Research Question

**Whether the time taken to make a recipe affect the number of calories?**

---

This question is important because understanding the relationship between cooking time and number of calories can help home cooks make better dietary decisions and optimize their meal plannings. For instance, people may asusme that recipes which takes longer to make are more indulgent, while quick recipes might be healthier. By analyzing this relationship, we can provide insights for users aiming for specific nutritional or time goals.

**Why this question matters?**
 Millions of people choose recipes based on preparation time and perceived healthiness. If there is a significant association between cooking time and the number of calories, users can make more informed choices according to their time constraints and nutritional goals. This analysis can also supplort food bloggers, diaticians, and recipe platforms in designing and recommeding recipes that meet different users' needs.
